Slide 1:
A SQL transaction is a grouping of one or more SQL statements that interact with a database. A transaction in its entirety can commit to a database as a single logical unit or rollback (become undone) as a single logical unit.

Slide 2: 
Some statements to control a transaction in SQL
COMMIT: save the changes
ROLLBACK: return to the state before changes were made
SAVEPOINT: create points in group of transactions for ROLLBACK
RELEASE SAVEPOINT: delete points created by SAVEPOINT
SET TRANSACTION: specify characteristics of a transaction

In SQL, there is no explicit statement which signifies a begin of a transaction.
However, every transaction must have an explicit end statement, which is either a COMMIT or ROLLBACK

Slide 3: 
COMMIT is the SQL command that is used for storing changes performed by a transaction. 

Syntax: COMMIT;

When a COMMIT command is issued it saves all the changes since last COMMIT or ROLLBACK.

Slide 5: 
ROLLBACK is the SQL command that is used for reverting changes performed by a transaction.

Syntax: ROLLBACK or ROLLBACK savepoint_name

When a ROLLBACK command is issued it reverts all the changes since last COMMIT or ROLLBACK.

Slide 7: 
SAVEPOINT is the SQL command that is used for declaring the name of a new savepoint within the current SQL transaction.

Syntax: SAVEPOINT savepoint_name

A transaction can be ROLLBACK-ed to one of the savepoints within itself instead of its beginning.

Slide 8: Hình demo

Slide 9:
RELEASE SAVEPOINT is the SQL command that is used for removing the named savepoint from the set of savepoints of the current transaction.

Syntax: RELEASE SAVEPOINT savepoint_name

It is an error if the savepoint does not exist. 

Slide 10: Hình demo

Slide 11: 
SET TRANSACTION is the SQL command that is used for specifying transaction characteristics.
The characteristics are the access mode, the diagnostic area size, and the isolation level.

Syntax:   


Slide 12: 
The access mode can be specified as READ ONLY or READ WRITE.
A mode of READ WRITE allows select, update, insert, delete, and create commands to be executed. 
A mode of READ ONLY,
as the name implies, is simply for data retrieval.


Slide 13:
The diagnostic area size option, DIAGNOSTIC SIZE n x, specifies an integer value n,
which indicates the number of condition area and a variable x which contains the maximum number of condition areas for the current transaction.

Slide 14:
The isolation level option is specified using the statement ISOLATION LEVEL <isolation>,
where the value for <isolation> can be READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED,
REPEATABLE READ, or SERIALIZABLE.

If a transaction executes at a lower isolation level than SERIALIZABLE, then one or more of the following three violations may occur: 
Dirty read
Nonrepeatable read
Phantoms
